<p>SpaceWarps is a Zooniverse project,  to be launched in Spring 2013, that
will crowd-source the discovery of gravitational lenses.  While the Zooniverse
dev team are building the main site, identification interface, and discussion
and exploration system,  the science team are developing a number of prototype
webpages to help our volunteers learn  about gravitational lenses - what they
look like, and how they work - as quickly as possible.</p>


<h3>The Spotter's Guide</h3>

<p>We want to show people what lenses look like - and what they don't! The
Spotter's Guide will be an  interactive gallery of both known lenses and some
common sources of confusion, that are  relevant to the current survey's
data.</p>

<a href="SpottersGuide/index.html">Under construction...</a>


<h3>Gravitational Lens Playground</h3>

<p>We have built a little lens simulator, called "LensToy," to show people
very quickly what gravitational lenses do - you place a source "behind" a
massive galaxy in the image shown to you, and LensToy shows you what the 
corresponding lensed features would look like. </p>

<a href="Playground/index.html">Go on, have a play!</a>


<h3>Gravitational Lens School</h3>

<p>We'd like people to understand a bit about how spacewarps work - so on the
School page, we try and explain the physics of gravitational lensing.' </p>
