Space Warps
-----------

Crowd-sourced discovery of gravitational lenses. We are a Zooniverse project, 
which launched in Spring 2013 at [http://spacewarps.org](http://spacewarps.org). This repository contains code and documentation
being developed by the science team.

Two papers on the first dataset we searched for lenses, the CFHTLS, are being prepared:

* [Marshall et al 2015, in prep: Crowd-sourcing the Discovery of Gravitational Lenses](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/SpaceWarps/raw/master/doc/sw-system.pdf)
* [More et al 2015, in prep: Results from CFHTLS](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/SpaceWarps/raw/master/doc/sw-cfhtls.pdf)

The web app itself is being developed [here](https://github.com/zooniverse/Lens-Zoo) as part of the [Zooniverse](http://zooniverse.org) project. If you are interested in building a site like Space Warps using Zooniverse techology, keep an eye on their website or drop them a line.

All our code is free to re-use under the GPL v2 license, which just means you have to make yours available in the same way. If you make use of any of it in your research, please cite us at this website, and (for now) as *"(Marshall et al, More et al in preparation)"*. Please do get in touch though - it would be great to collaborate on improving the SWAP analysis, for example!
