    NAME
        SWAP.py

    PURPOSE
        Space Warps Analysis Pipeline
        
        Read in a Space Warps classification database from a MongoDB 
        database, and analyse it.

    COMMENTS
        The SW analysis is "online" in the statistical sense: we step 
        through the classifications one by one, updating each
        classifier's confusion matrix and each subject's lens
        probability. The main reason for taking this approach is that
        it is the most logical one; secondarily, it opens up the
        possibility of performing the analysis in real time (although
        presumably not with this piece of python).

        Currently, the confusion matrices only depend on the
        classifications of training subjects. Upgrading this would be a
        nice piece of further work. Likewise, neither the Marker
        positions, the classification  durations, nor any other
        parameters are used in estimating lens probability - but they
        could be. In this version, it's LENS or NOT.

        Standard operation is to update the candidate list by making a
        new, timestamped catalog of candidates - and the
        classifications that led to them. This means we have to know
        when the last update was made - this is done by reading in a
        pickle of the last classification to be SWAPped. The final
        sample of candidates could be obtained by reading  in all
        sample pickles and taking the most up to date characterisation
        of  each - but we might as well over-write a pickle of this
        every time too. The crowd we have to always read in in its
        entirety, because they can reappear any time to update their
        confusion matrices.
