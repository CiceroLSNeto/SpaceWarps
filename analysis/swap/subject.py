    NAME
        Subject

    PURPOSE
        Model an individual Space Warps subject.

    COMMENTS
        Each subject knows whether it is a test or training subject, and
        it knows its truth (which is different according to category).
        Each subject (regardless of category) has a probability of 
        being a LENS, and this is tracked along a trajectory.
        
        Subject state:
          * active    Still being classified
          * inactive  No longer being classified
        Training subjects are always active. Retired = inactive.

        Subject status: 
          * detected  P > detection_threshold
          * rejected  P < rejection_threshold
          * undecided otherwise
        
        Subject categories:
          * test      A subject from the test (random, survey) set
          * training  A training subject, either a sim or a dud
        
        Subject kinds:
          * test      A subject from the test (random, survey) set
          * sim       A training subject containing a simulated lens
          * dud       A training subject known not to contain any lenses
        
        Subject truths:
          * LENS      It actually is a LENS (sim)
          * NOT       It actually is NOT a LENS (dud)
          * UNKNOWN   It could be either (test)
