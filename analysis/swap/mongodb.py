    NAME
        MongoDB

    PURPOSE
        Interrogate an actual mongo database, and serve up data for a 
        a simple python analysis.

    COMMENTS
        The mongodb server must be running in the background (perhaps 
        started from another shell. A typical sequence would be:
        
        cd workspace
        mongorestore spacewarps-2013-04-06_20-07-28
        mongod --dbpath . &
        
        pymongo can be obtained by pip install.
        This sequence is carried out by the MongoDB class itself, via a 
        system call.
        
        Basic operation is to define a "classification" tuple, that 
        contains all the information needed by a probabilistic online 
        analysis. At present, in SWAP, this is a simple "LENS" or "NOT"
        classification, with classification agent confusion matrices 
        updated using the training subjects, and the test subjects'
        Pr(LENS|d) updated using these matrices.


    INITIALISATION
        
    
    METHODS AND VARIABLES
        ToyDB.get_classification()
        
    BUGS
        - groupIds are hard-coded, and so could go wrong any time.
        - arc hits in sim subjects are not yet recorded.
