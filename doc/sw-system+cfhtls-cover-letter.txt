Dear Editors,

We are submitting two papers on the first Space Warps project. We have numbered
them I and II to make it clear that they are best read together, and if possible
we would very much like them to be refereed by the same reviewer, and
also appear next to each other in the journal if accepted.

Thanks very much for your consideration,

Phil Marshall, Anupreeta More & Aprajita Verma
Space Warps project PIs
