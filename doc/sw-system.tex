\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Scientific motivation. Applications of lenses: group-scale arcs,
galaxy-galaxy lenses, lensed quasars. 

Problem of rarity. Imaging surveys. Problem of purity/false positives.

Review of progress to date. Methods in SL2S, SQLS. Contrast with SLACS. 

Scaling to wide field era. Automated methods: problems. Need for good
training sets. Need for quality control: always present.

Novel solution: crowd-sourcing. Brief review of similar problems.
PlanetHunters. \sw as an experiment.

In this paper, we describe the \sw website, an online system that
enables crowd-sourced detection of gravitational lenses. 
Other papers in this series will present new gravitational lenses
discovered in our first imaging survey dataset, and investigate the
differences between lens detections made in \sw and those made with
automated techniques. Here, we try to answer the following questons:
\begin{itemize}

\item How reliably can we find gravitational lenses using the \sw
system? What is the completeness of the sample produced?

\item How noisy is the system? What is the purity of the sample
produced?

\item How accurately can gravitational lenses be located on the sky
during the identification process?

\item How quickly can lenses be detected? How many classifiers are
needed per target, and how quickly can they mobilise?

\end{itemize}

In \Sref{sec:overview} we...

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

Interpreting clicks. Online analysis: update model of each volunteer,
and estimate probability of classification.

Training data for tracking learning, and estimating completeness and
purity.

Understanding crowd, so we can help them learn faster. Understanding
images given the crowd, so we can find lenses.
