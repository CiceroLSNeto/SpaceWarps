Notes on SpaceWarps git repository
----------------------------------

SpaceWarps is a repo with two branches:

  master   = the development area
  gh-pages = the published version, visible at 
               http://drphilmarshall.github.com/SpaceWarps
               
The workflow is:
  * Create and edit files in master
  * Commit changes, and push to origin master for others to pull down
  * When we want to "publish" webpages, merge master into gh-pages
  
gh-pages represents a stable version of the repository, that we are willing
the world to see. It contains some additional directories and files, used in
the formatting of the index.html page. The prototype webpages should be as
clean as possible, to make it easy for the Zoo builders to take what they need
from them.

To publish, you need to switch to the gh-pages branch, and merge master into
it, like this:

$  git checkout gh-pages
$  git merge master

The checkout command switches us to the master branch. At this point the
master branch is no longer visible. The merge command takes the new files and
changes and merges them in to the gh-pages folder. If everything is cool, you
can then push to the remote github server, to update the website. You do this
with git push - but because you are not pushing to the default destination, 
origin master, you need to tell git where to push to:

$  git push origin gh-pages
