# Email from Anu:
# 
# 
#    Hi Phil and Aprajita,
# 
#    I think its best that I send you tar files of the pngs and we maintain our
#    own catalogs with our comments/remarks/votes -- let's decide beforehand
#    what keywords/categories to use and what to vote and how.
# 
#    Once we all are done, we combine our catalogs and share it online.
# 
#    You will find the tar files here:
# 
#    1. Claude's sample
# 
#    http://member.ipmu.jp/anupreeta.more/claudepngs.tgz -- most of them are
#    ring galaxies or face on spirals, some are known sarcs / ring lenses
# 
#    2. Rings sample
# 
#    http://member.ipmu.jp/anupreeta.more/ringpngs.tgz -- most look fine to me,
#    so they might be worth adding.
# 
#    Note some candidates are repeated since they are at the edges of the
#    cutouts.
# 
#    3. Sarcs sample
# 
#    http://member.ipmu.jp/anupreeta.more/sarcspngs.tgz sorry, I don't have a
#    well maintained list of followed-up list. There's a "good" candidate list
#    based on average ranking but I've included the all A/B/C category lens
#    candidates. If some candidates are not interesting (from any point of
#    view), we can simply exclude them.
# 
#    cheers,
# 
#    Anu

# Here's a sample of 500 false positives. 
# http://member.ipmu.jp/anupreeta.more/falsepos_stg2.tgz
# 
# Please send me IDs of those images which you think may have a lens and should be removed from this sample. I will then select 450 out of the remaining sample.
# 
# Typical types of false positives that people have identified as lenses
# 1) lots of low-medium redshift face on spirals
# 2) lots of high redshift star-forming galaxies
# 3) some edge-on galaxies  (expecting to have doubles / quad sometimes)
# 4) some very nearby ellipticals + spirals (expecting to have doubles / quad sometimes)
# 5) some stars are thought of as lenses
# 6) some edge-on galaxies are thought of as arcs 
# 
# The pop-up messages will have to be written accordingly. 


# Talked to Anu about alt category scheme, based on spotters guide - go
# with this, and potentially extend guide.
# 
# RING.........R
# SPIRAL.......S
# LIGHTWEIGHT..I
# LONER........O
# MERGER.......M
# NEIGHBOUR....N
# 
# And use X for "do not use" - because there's more than one FP, or
# because the image contains a lens.

cd falsepos_stg2

# Make gallery, 3x3 per page, with names:

gallery.pl -x 3 -y 3 -pdf -t CFHTLS*png -o falsepos_stg2_gallery.pdf

# Now start catalog:

\ls *png | awk '{printf "%s   X\n", $0}' > falsepos_stg2_pjm.txt

# New categories: 

WEAKLENS......W  (the arc is far and/or straight: weak lensing only)
STAR..........T  (the "lens" is a red star)

# Rejected as category by Anu, wth good reason...
AGN...........A  (there is a single blue point source in the centre)
FOREGROUND....F  (the "images" are foreground stars)

# Both of these could be labelled as Neighbours - do this at the end.

# 2013-07-30 (Tuesday) 11:08 PDT
# Suggestions from Anu and AV:
# 
# Thanks for inspecting and sorting them. I'd like to suggest a few minor
# changes.
# 
# AM: Move from A-gal --> A-group:
# CFHTLS_082_5924_11413_o_gri.png - the central galaxy is a BGG/BCG. 
# PJM: Agreed!
# 
# AM: Move from B-gal --> A-gal:
# CFHTLS_169_1956_6554_o_gri.png - probably, a confirmed lens with an arc +
# counter-image; not sure why this is put under grade B
# PJM: This was an error! Thanks.
#
# AM: Possibly, move from B-group --> A-group:
# CFHTLS_002_4206_11323_o_gri.png - this is a nice quad in a group but might be
# difficult to see. If you think this can be confusing, then we can leave it as
# it is.
# PJM: It is hard to see - but lets put it in A, once you see it its cool :-)
# 
# in A-groups:
# AV: i'm not sure about using CFHTLS_074_18341_12173_o_gri.png this just looks
# like an alignement to me but i might be wrong (or it might even be confirmed!)
# AM: To my knowledge, this is not confirmed and is a less likely system but
# don't feel too strongly for or against keeping it.
# PJM: I'm OK with leaving it out, I agree its confusing.
# 
# AV: CFHTLS_155_8541_17936_o_gri.png is this a reasonable separation? i think
# it's too wide and we should not use it in the SG
# AM: This is an almost certain lens system. the arc's in a group, so wide
# separation is justifiable, can stay in group A.
# PJM: Let's keep it in the guide with appropriate apprehensiveness.
#
# 
# in B-galaxies:
# 
# AV: what's wrong with CFHTLS_126_12103_3919_o_gri.png?
# AM: If you zoom in on the png, it seems too straight and the arc has gradient
# in colors indicating some possibility of chance alignments of distinct objects
# or so. The counter-image seems too far given the distance of the arc from the
# galaxy. This looks as a less likely lens candidate to me.
# PJM: Agreed. Looks a bit fishy
# 
# AV: isnt there a counter in CFHTLS_169_1956_6554_o_gri.png that makes it grade
# A?
# AM: This is almost 100% a lens and should be moved to grade A. 
# PJM: Done, as above.
#  
#
# in B-groups:
# AV: CFHTLS_132_6627_6100_o_gri.png shows giant arcs, doesnt it?
# AM: Probably, phil thought its not very promising. i had left it in but not
# too keen on keeping or leaving it out. 
# PJM: I guess I thought it was hard to see! But lets keep it in and keep
# people sharp.
#  
# AV: CFHTLS_156_4754_6956_o_gri.png if this isn't lensing i dont think these
# are SF tidal tails - i think we should show a couple of add thigns to catch
# any exotic lenses otherwise we may bias the user group to standard things
# AM: Phil should comment if he feels strongly against including this, i had
# left it in.
# PJM: Good point re oddballs. I was erring against them, but we do want to
# catch them so yes. A. This system is not at all well understood though!
#
#
# Implemented changes by hand in finknwnlens_sg_stg2_catalog.txt, moved that
# up a directory, remade galleries. 

# Now use this catalog and the associated images to make Spotters Guide pages,
# over in the Dev website. Copy the grade A system images! Make sure we
# are in teh dev branch first...
