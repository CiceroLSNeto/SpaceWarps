Real Lenses:

Gallery: beautiful !

Lensed galaxies: I thought red arcs were from "nearby galaxies" z=0.6 and red quasars produce star-like images.
To avoid confusion about which image is being talked about, can you put an arrow
? at the beginning of the paragraph, pointing up to the image that is being discussed.last line: "Above are some examples of how the edge-on lens systems look like" change "how" to "what"
I had to go back and look to see if the image below or above was being discussed.

Lensed quasars:
"with two images very close together." to "with two of the quad images very close together"
Remove white dividing lines? 

Group lenses:
lovely !

False Positives: Good.

Star-forming galaxies:
Good examples, thank you.
typo "The ring arounf the core"  to around
red star-forming galaxies typo  "The ed objects either side may be stars or neighbouring galaxies" ed to red

The red galaxies that we see are a reasonable size on the image. Tiny red objects on the image can't be massive red galaxies, because if the galaxy was more distant, the light from it would get red-shifted and our telescope is unable to see infrared light.

Loners:
needed these examples, too.

Lightweights
excellent

Mergers and Neighbours
"that aren't physically associated to each other, but are simply next to each other can look"
change location of comma to make it read better
that aren't physically associated to each other but are simply next to each other, can look 

"Here you see a yellow galaxy with a coupld of small neighbours. One of the neighbours is blue, and the other is a similar colour to the main"
I have a hard time seeing the blue neighbors, can you pick a different example?
typo "couple"

Stars
Here is what I really like! Labels! I could have done with that at the beginning.
In the last image, there is a blue star with black specks. Say that it is an overloaded sensor.
emmanating typo emanating

Artifacts
Moderators need this. People don't look in the posts or blogs. It needs to be in the Spotter's Guide.
The same topics keep coming up, and I'm sure people don't like making beginner mistakes.

satellite, asteroids and moving objects
overlapping star not a supernova (I did this in my first day in Galaxy Zoo, I am so embarrassed to say)
what is the funny red/green/blue speck? ( cosmic ray hit)
black holes are not visible in the images, nor are galactic jets, and the topic keeps coming up.
edges, as was mentioned
The images are heavily processed, and software errors sometimes produce weird effects.

http://talk.spacewarps.org/#/subjects/ASW00000pw funny green spot

Do we need a page on how to use Tools?

Great job that you have done, Christine
